# SQL Advent Calendar 2025 - 24 Days of Real-World SQL Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to Interview Master's 24-day SQL Advent Calendar challenge - — a 25-day series 
of practical, holiday-themed SQL problems created by Interview Master and led by Dawn Choo and Jeremiah Clark.

Each day presents a new business-style data scenario (from toy deliveries to ski resorts and holiday staffing), and I write 
SQL queries to solve them using industry-standard data analysis techniques.

This project is part of my ongoing effort to:

a) Strengthen my SQL skills

b) Practice real-world data problem solving

c) Build a public portfolio of analytics work

## About the Challenge
